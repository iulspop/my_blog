After a long time of thinking about it, I started a blog in a couple hours with a Gatsby template. I couldn't wait a single more day to start the habit of journaling what I'm learning about. I want to write my thoughts about the cool things I'm learning without needing to develop every update into a full article.

I was inspired by swyx to dive deep into learning in public: https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/.
