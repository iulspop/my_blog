description: My first 3 month plan. The point is to create a few outcomes that
  will bring me closer to my goal of being a machine learning engineer.

I have been reviewing my processes in response to things I've learned in Benjamin P. Hardy's 30 Days Future Self course.

The key thing the course is about prospection, which is making representations of the future. The idea is your vue of your future shapes your present identity and behaviour. So, we can deliberately create representations of our future to influence present actions.

I've found applying this idea to a powerful lever in my mind to reshape myself. I highly recommend to anyone to try the free course: https://30dayfutureself.com

A keystone goal related to my future self is becoming a machine learning engineer. Accomplishing that will change my life dramatically. I've made a plan to accomplish that, but it is too large to apply prospection to as whole. I mean there are too many steps and it's too long a process for the vision to influence my actions and the outcomes I create in the radical way I want. So, I've broken it down into three outcomes I want to create in the next 90 days.

Objective: **Get closer to the skill to be competitive in job market as software engineer.**

Key Results:

* Complete Core back-end courses
* Full incremental process: The Linux Command Line, 2nd Edition: A Complete Introduction
* Complete Pre-Algebra and Algebra courses Khan Academy

Having just these three outcomes in mind for next 90 days is a more wieldy. I can definitely know whether or not my actions make the boat go faster towards that. It is ambitious enough to force me to grow along certain vectors in order to accomplish it, but not so much I would be incentivised to compromise on things like mastery-based learning.

The stategy I have to accomplish this involves:

* A polarised training model
* Formalizing and refining my learning processes.
* Prospection, journaling and various techniques to bring out all the abilities of my body and mind to create the outcome I've commited to.

I'm currently preparing articles about each one of those topics to share what I've learned.
