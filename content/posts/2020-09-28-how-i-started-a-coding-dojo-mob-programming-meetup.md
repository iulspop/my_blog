I stumbled into starting a coding dojo. It's been a fun learning experience so far!

I'd been attending a Software Crafters Montreal meetup for almost a year. The hosts knew me well, so when I asked if they'll do an online coding dojo, they offered me the opportunity to organize it.

I let the idea brew for a couple weeks while I finished other things I started. Once I had a clearer idea what I wanted the meetup to be like and I felt I could focus on organizing it, I asked a friend if she would organize it with me. She agreed!

We made a plan, got feedback from the meetup founder, and wrote and published an annoucement.
The gist of the meetup is to solve limited coding challenges with the focus not on shipping code, but improving our coding and collaboration habits. We'd focus on different skills as we went, starting with remote mob programming.

I hadn't done remote mob programming before, so I read what other's learned about it and tried it with my friends to practice the setup process and how to facilate the session before for the meetup.

I'll write an easy checklist with what you need in order faciliate a mob programming session for a coding dojo. Watch out for that guide!
