Almost a month has passed since I set an ambitious three month plan and I've made good progress. I did excellent on the programming fundamentals assessments and started the Ruby OOP course.

However, I'm wildy off target of the ambitious goal I set. The most significant cause is frankly I've distracted myself with things that seem and feel important, but are not. Something that is of close secondary importance to the one most important thing is what's most likely to cause distraction. I wonder by what means would you condition your mind to have full clarity on what's important and fully relinquish atttention to anything else? How to become a "successful warrior" like Bruce Lee says here:  " â€ŽThe successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus."

So far, what I have in mind is to focus my writing, journaling and prayer more twawrds developing this clarity and constantly recalling what's important. For me, what's importan right now is completing the vanilla Launch School core curriculum. That means not deviating at all into extra topics. As I write that, ideas come to mind of all the things that would be nice to do, like a meetup about machine learning, expanding the coding dojo meetup I started... What's important? What's not 'nice to have', but absolutely necessary?

Apparently I don't feel clear about that question. Another way to frame it is would it make a difference if I didn't do some of those nice to haves? What would it change? Is that worth pulling my focus from the one thing? If I use the if it's not FUCK YEAH! or no rule, then it's no, it's not worth it all.

Focus is the number one thing I need to master to complete the core curriculum ASAP. The one thing I should do is constantly tune myself into clarity of what's important and relinquish attention to everything else.
